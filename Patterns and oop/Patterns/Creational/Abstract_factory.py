"""
We often start with Factory method pattern and if need more abilities or types to create with
special hierarchy than we develop abstract factory


Use cases
We were creating dors of different types but suddenly understand that we also need to make many other kinds of furniture
but of some particular class (like baroco style and classic style or whatever else style) then we need abstract
factory (factory for factories)
